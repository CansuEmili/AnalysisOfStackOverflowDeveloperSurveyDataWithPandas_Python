**Analysis of Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data with Pandas (Python)**

**Goal:** To analyze the data from the Stack Overflow annual survey. The purpose is to understand trends in the tech world by studying developersâ€™ programming choices, work experience, salary levels, and learning sources.

**Method and Tools:** Used Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and the 2024 Stack Overflow Survey data. The project includes data cleaning, filtering, grouping, counting, comparing, and basic descriptive statistics.

**Results:** Python is used by many developers (47% of participants). Online courses are a common way to learn (46%). Remote work is popular (32% fully remote, 35% hybrid). There are big salary differences between countries. Developers with higher salaries often have good education and work in software, consulting, or finance.

**Skills Gained:** Data analysis with Python Pandas, working with large datasets, user segmentation by programming language, data visualization, and telling stories with data.
